# DDLC Mod: Die Another Day
Inspired by all the interesting mods out there being developed for *Doki Doki Literature Club!*, I attepted to create my own!
It's a super basic mod where you play as a self-aware MC who, after getting the ending with spending eternity with Monika, is somehow placed at the beginning of the game. You, or MC rather, decide that you have a new chance to save the others and expose Monika for the murderer she is!

## How To Play
To play this mod you'll need a fresh download of *Doki Doki Literature Club!* that you can find [here](https://ddlc.moe/ "DDLC").
After downloading the original game, then download this mod directly from github!

Once you have both files, navigate to the file called 'game' in the original DDLC files you first downloaded. Then, navigate to the file called 'game' in the mod files you downloaded here.

Copy the contents of the 'game' file from the mod files you downloaded here and pase them into the the file called 'game' in the original DDLC files you first downloaded. 

Once this is all done you should be able to run the mod!
