# DDLC Mod: Die Another Day
Inspired by all the interesting mods out there being developed for *Doki Doki Literature Club!*, I attepted to create my own!
It's a super basic mod where you play as a self-aware MC who, after getting the ending with spending eternity with Monika, is somehow placed at the beginning of the game. You, or MC rather, decide that you have a new chance to save the others and expose Monika for the murderer she is!

## How To Play
To play this mod you'll need a fresh download of *Doki Doki Literature Club!* that you can find [here](https://ddlc.moe/ "DDLC").
